This is an attempt to recreate Dhaval Patel tutorial from youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4yCWBGFCEs&t=3384s).

The differences that I have incorporated are, 
	- The users can input their API key (this idea was grabbed from here https://github.com/streamlit/llm-examples/blob/main/Chatbot.py)
	- Few more cuisines are included.
